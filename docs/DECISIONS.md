# Decision Log

## Hostinger runtime dependency repair — 2026-09-21

- Production logs show Next.js cannot resolve `@swc/helpers/_/_interop_require_default`.
  The existing lockfile already contains the correct helper version (0.5.15).
  Mixed flat and virtual-store Next.js paths suggest deployment layout problems;
  the exact Hostinger packaging step has not been independently inspected.
- Use `nodeLinker: hoisted` and explicitly declare `@swc/helpers@0.5.15` as a
  production dependency. Preserve the other locked package versions.
- Check dependency resolution from both the application and Next.js before build
  and normal start. Hostinger-generated entrypoints may bypass `prestart`, so run
  `node scripts/check-runtime-dependencies.mjs` against the deployed artifact too.
- No migrations, seed changes, commercial settings, or authentication changes
  are part of this repair. A clean installation/build is necessary to replace the
  previously packaged dependency tree.

## Task 001 package and implementation decisions — 2026-06-30

- Node.js 24 LTS is pinned in `package.json`; it is both an active LTS release and a Hostinger-supported managed runtime.
- pnpm 11.7.0 is pinned through the `packageManager` field.
- Next.js 16.2.9, React 19.2.7, Tailwind CSS 4.3.2, Prisma 7.8.0, TypeScript 6.0.3, Vitest 4.1.9, and Playwright 1.61.1 are pinned for reproducible installs.
- MySQL 8.4 is used in Docker Compose because it is the MySQL 8 LTS line.
- RSA public-key retrieval is an explicit environment opt-in for the local non-TLS MySQL account and remains disabled by default outside local configuration.
- Credentials authentication uses Auth.js-compatible `User` and `Session` fields with a custom credentials handler. Auth.js credentials providers require JWT session strategy, which conflicts with this task's database-session requirement.
- Raw session secrets are never stored in MySQL. The browser receives the opaque token in an HTTP-only cookie, while MySQL stores an HMAC-SHA256 digest.
- Route protection is layered: the Next.js proxy rejects missing cookies, while server layouts validate the live database session and capability.
- The in-memory login limiter is an initial single-instance defense. A shared limiter is required before multi-instance deployment.
- `assets/branding/osrs-services-logo.svg` is the repository-approved Task 001 development wordmark. It must be replaced with the final approved transparent asset before homepage approval.

## Homepage redesign and content management decisions — 2026-08-26

- The client-supplied black, red and white storefront direction supersedes the earlier green development theme for public-facing routes; the protected admin workspace remains utility-led.
- Homepage curation is additive: `HomepageSection` controls section state and limits, while `HomepageItem` points to existing services, products, accounts, gold or custom-build records and also supports manual promotions.
- Promotional prices are hidden by default unless the client supplies a verified linked price or an explicit override. Unverified reference-screenshot prices and performance metrics are not presented as business facts.
- Homepage image uploads accept only safe raster formats and remain replaceable from the admin manager. The initial artwork uses the approved supplied reference and original derived hero artwork.
- The normal steady-state deployment prebuild should generate the Prisma client and apply pending migrations without repeatedly seeding. For the one-time Hostinger homepage initialization, `prebuild` temporarily generates the client, runs the pure Node/MariaDB `scripts/hostinger-sql-migrate.mjs`, and executes the seed directly through Node + `tsx`. Hostinger cannot execute Prisma's native schema engine, so production migrations must not call `prisma migrate deploy` or `PRISMA_SCHEMA_ENGINE_BINARY`. The custom runner preserves Prisma-compatible history, exact-file checksums, an advisory lock, and fail-closed incomplete-migration handling. Keep the temporary seed until the client confirms deployment succeeded; never use reset or other destructive database commands.

## Task 003 catalogue decisions — 2026-07-01

- Categories and services use stable IDs plus unique URL slugs; services also retain a unique canonical-ready slug for later migration and SEO work.
- Game modes, requirements, media references and publication revisions are normalized rather than stored as editable JSON blobs.
- Engine type is stored as a typed selection only. Task 003 does not execute calculators, pricing, inventory, checkout or marketplace engines.
- Scheduled visibility is evaluated at request time. No worker or scheduler is introduced.
- Previously published services are archived rather than permanently deleted. Publication, republication and archive events create immutable content snapshots.
- Public queries use an allow-listed scalar projection that excludes internal notes, legacy metadata and actor relations.
- Media management accepts only internal paths and HTTP(S) references with alt text. Production upload/storage remains deferred.
- Seeded catalogue records use stable seed keys and empty update clauses so reruns add missing defaults without overwriting edited content or operational state.
- Category/service mutation inputs are explicitly allow-listed and Zod-validated. Optimistic service versions reject stale editor submissions.

## Task 004 catalogue-card and eligibility decisions — 2026-07-06

- Offerings are normalized children of `CatalogueService`; publication remains inherited from the parent.
- Task 003 stage snapshots upgrade from schema version 1 to version 2 on read. Existing stages/revisions remain readable; new revisions include offerings and eligibility rules.
- Published offering edits remain in the versioned service stage. Republish replaces the aggregate transactionally while retaining staged stable IDs.
- Empty offering game-mode rows mean inheritance; explicit rows may only narrow parent modes.
- Automatic eligibility accepts only allow-listed metrics and typed comparisons. Unknown or missing metrics require support review.
- Official OSRS Hiscores is the deployed provider. Deterministic fixture mode is an explicit local/test switch that also supports local production-build E2E; it must remain disabled in deployments.
- Cache and limiter keys are HMAC-derived. No RuneScape password, raw IP, provider URL, raw response, or lookup history is stored.
- Catalogue cards remain quote/review only. Pricing, cart, checkout and Task 005 remain outside scope.

## Final structural redesign and direct ordering decisions - 2026-09-07

- Primary service navigation now targets `/skills`, `/bossing`, `/infernal`, `/quests`, `/diaries`, `/gold`, `/products`, and `/misc-gathering`. Known legacy category and detail URLs issue server redirects to those useful destinations; catalogue records remain intact for Admin, foreign keys, and SEO continuity.
- Skills, bossing, premium, and gold continue to use their specialized server pricing engines. Quest, diary, and gathering selections use one small direct-order client with a deterministic shared calculation module and a server cart repricing adapter.
- `CATALOGUE_OFFERING_ESTIMATE` is a first-class immutable cart/order item kind. The browser sends stable service/offering selections only; the server reloads published data, validates account mode and quantity, calculates integer-cent totals, applies global pricing, and stores readable source and price snapshots.
- Existing catalogue offerings are the commercial source of truth. No new live quest, diary, gathering, boss, skill, item, ETA, or requirement values were invented. Missing ETAs render as `Confirmed after review` and are editable through the existing staged offering editor.
- Diary dependency policy is explicit offering metadata. `dependency-behavior=auto-include` adds earlier regional tiers; otherwise the public UI states that earlier tiers must already be complete. The seeded reference diary catalogue uses the conservative `require-complete` policy.
- Infernal is a dedicated premium configuration using the existing staged premium package/option architecture. Zero-value option modifiers preserve approved reference pricing while clearly remaining client-reviewable; disabled delivery methods are not displayed.
- Gold volume discounts are optional JSON-backed rate data, expressed as threshold GP plus integer basis points. The highest eligible published customer-buy tier applies. No discount percentages are seeded.
- Product estimates now refresh automatically after variant or quantity changes. Seeded product inventory remains in manual-review state, so cart submission stays disabled until staff approve availability, stock, and commercial data in the existing product Admin.
- The additive migration is compatible with the pure Node/MariaDB Hostinger runner. It extends cart/order enums, adds nullable offering ETA and gold discount columns, and updates/adds homepage merchandising rows without removing or resetting data. Hostinger scripts and `prebuild` remain unchanged.
- Skill and boss portraits reuse the client-supplied reference images as CSS sprites; an Admin-uploaded image overrides the fallback. Unknown bosses keep semantic icons until approved artwork is available. Misc Gathering uses a newly generated resource illustration; its provenance and prompt are recorded in the completion report.
- Published premium stat-price bands are optional, non-overlapping 1–99 level ranges for Ranged, Magic, Defence, and Prayer. The server applies the same bands to displayed quotes and cart repricing. No surcharge is seeded; normal pricing updates use staged, authorized Admin publishing.
- Direct catalogue quotes call the same cart resolver used for insertion, including published global adjustments. All automatic calculators invalidate stale cart sources immediately and preserve edited values during quote requests.
- Three additive migrations cover direct ordering, the allocation enum, and premium stat pricing. Local-only E2E fixtures opt in to a guarded loopback database, restore Gold/Product inventory, and remove only the newly inserted test product revision.

## Screenshot-led storefront refinement — 2026-09-10

- This pass replaces the previous oversized catalogue/form presentation with the client's compact header, illustrated service navigation, left-hand selectors, right-hand summaries, quest/item tables, and regional diary cards. Public styling is scoped in `reference-storefront.css`; staff screens and deployment scripts are unchanged.
- The existing official wordmark is preserved and displayed in red in the public header/footer, regardless of an older green-logo environment override. Its original raster is cropped through CSS rather than edited. Client reference boards supply artwork-only CSS crops; missing boss portraits retain a clearly generic fallback rather than another boss's image.
- Commercial content still comes from existing published records, not prices, ETAs, difficulty labels, or stock shown in design mockups. Gold cards label their calculated pre-adjustment amounts as base prices; the order summary uses the server-confirmed quote including discounts/global adjustments.
- Items now reuse the existing product quote/cart component inside a real marketplace table, including variant selection, quantities, validation and manual-review/stock states. Product-detail ordering remains available.
- Homepage service shortcuts are navigation, not invented products. Existing Admin-managed categories, featured cards and service promotions still render with their schedules, item limits, overrides and section switches. The homepage is dynamic so published merchandising updates do not require rebuilding.
- No new schema, seed, rate, payment, authorization, or inventory rules are introduced. This delivery is a GitHub source update; no production deployment or production database mutation is performed.
