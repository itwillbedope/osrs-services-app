# Deployment Plan

## Current environment

- Domain: osrsservices.com
- Hosting: Hostinger Business Web Hosting
- Existing production site: WordPress and WooCommerce

## Development

Build locally first. Keep the current website live. Use separate development data and no live payment configuration.

Local MySQL is optional for Task 007 validation handoff. The draft PR workflow `.github/workflows/task007-validation.yml` runs the full Task 007 validation suite on GitHub-hosted runners with temporary MySQL 8.4 service containers, then uploads screenshots, validation reports and the final review pack as workflow artifacts. These CI databases and credentials are disposable and must not be reused for production.

Local MySQL is also optional for Task 008 handoff validation. `.github/workflows/task008-validation.yml` runs fresh MySQL validation, Task 007-to-Task 008 upgrade validation, tests, screenshots and review-pack generation on GitHub-hosted MySQL 8.4 service containers.

Local MySQL remains optional for Task 009 handoff validation. `.github/workflows/task009-validation.yml` runs fresh MySQL validation, Task 008-to-Task 009 upgrade validation, tests, screenshots and review-pack generation on GitHub-hosted MySQL 8.4 service containers.

Local MySQL remains optional for Task 010, Task 011, Task 012, Task 013, Task 014, Task 015 and Task 016 handoff validation. `.github/workflows/task010-validation.yml`, `.github/workflows/task011-validation.yml`, `.github/workflows/task012-validation.yml`, `.github/workflows/task013-validation.yml`, `.github/workflows/task014-validation.yml`, `.github/workflows/task015-validation.yml` and `.github/workflows/task016-validation.yml` run their database-backed checks on GitHub-hosted MySQL 8.4 service containers with disposable CI credentials.

## Staging

Create a staging environment before production. Test Hostinger's Node.js application support first. Use an alternative managed Node environment or VPS if the required custom server or real-time connections are limited.

## Production gate

Before switching the domain, verify migration, media, redirects, SSL, administrator access, backups, chat, payment provider approval, email, correctly enabled features, rollback, tests, and client approval. Run `pnpm production:check` against production-like values and inspect `/ready`.

The domain and email may remain at Hostinger even if the application later moves to a VPS or split deployment.

## Task 016 payment, email and launch-readiness notes

Task 016 adds migration `20260810150000_task016_payments_launch_readiness`. It is additive and creates payment provider configuration, eligibility, transactions, transaction events, webhook events, refunds, email templates, email delivery rows and launch-readiness settings.

Normal seed creates:

- `external_payments_enabled` disabled
- `payment_webhooks_enabled` disabled
- `payment_refunds_enabled` disabled
- manual review provider enabled
- TEST_HOSTED provider disabled and production blocked
- email templates marked `Needs client review`
- payment eligibility rules marked for merchant/client review

Before enabling payment or email features outside validation:

- run `pnpm db:migrate` without reset
- run `pnpm db:seed` twice and confirm edited flags and review rows are preserved
- review `/admin/payments`, `/admin/checkout/payment-eligibility`, `/admin/checkout/email` and `/admin/launch-readiness`
- review `docs/PAYMENT-PROVIDER-APPROVAL.md`
- confirm `PAYMENT_PROVIDER` is not `TEST_HOSTED` in production
- confirm `EMAIL_TRANSPORT` is not `TEST_EMAIL` when production email delivery is enabled
- confirm terms, privacy and refund-policy pages have client-approved legal copy

Rollback is manual. First disable `external_payments_enabled`, `payment_webhooks_enabled`, `payment_refunds_enabled` and email delivery. Preserve orders, payment transactions, webhook events, refund rows, email delivery rows and audit rows before any schema rollback. Do not use `prisma migrate reset` against shared or production data.

## Eligibility configuration

Configure the server-only timeout, positive/negative cache TTLs, rate-limit window/count, proxy trust, and dedicated HMAC secret from `.env.example`. Never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` for secrets. Leave fixture mode and proxy-header trust disabled unless their documented assumptions are explicitly satisfied.

Run `prisma migrate deploy` without reset. Migration `20260706150000_task004_catalogue_engine_eligibility` is additive. Rollback is manual: disable eligibility, export new data, remove new foreign keys in dependency order, and only then remove Task 004 columns/tables after review.

## Skilling calculator deployment notes

Task 005 adds migration `20260711190000_task005_skilling_calculator_engine`. It is additive and creates skilling calculator tables plus enum values used by `CatalogueService.engineType = SKILLING_CALCULATOR`.

Normal seed runs create `skilling_calculator_enabled` disabled because the representative skilling rates and rules are still marked `Needs client review`. Staging or screenshot validation may enable the flag deliberately, but public rollout should wait for client-approved pricing and delivery configuration.

Before enabling the calculator outside local validation:

- run `pnpm db:migrate` without reset
- run `pnpm db:seed` and confirm seed reruns preserve edited skilling rules and feature flags
- confirm the database feature flag `skilling_calculator_enabled` is intentionally enabled
- review every seeded skilling method/rule marked `Needs client review`
- keep Priority and Express delivery disabled until the client approves those fees and estimates
- verify public estimates, admin skilling pages and mobile screenshots against staging data

Rollback is manual. First disable `skilling_calculator_enabled`, then export any admin-edited skilling rows and staged aggregates that must be retained. Remove dependent skilling methods, skills and rules before removing the Task 005 tables or enum usage. Do not use `prisma migrate reset` against shared or production data.

## Bossing calculator deployment notes

Task 006 adds migration `20260712180000_task006_bossing_pvm_engine`. It is additive and creates bossing calculator tables for rules, boss configs, methods, stat requirements and gear requirements. It uses the existing `CatalogueService.engineType = BOSSING_ENGINE` enum value.

Normal seed runs create `bossing_calculator_enabled` disabled because the representative bossing rates and rules are still marked `Needs client review`. Staging or screenshot validation may enable the flag deliberately, but public rollout should wait for client-approved boss/method pricing, requirement wording and delivery configuration.

Before enabling the calculator outside local validation:

- run `pnpm db:migrate` without reset
- run `pnpm db:seed` and confirm seed reruns preserve edited bossing rules, methods, feature flags, staged aggregates and revisions
- confirm the database feature flag `bossing_calculator_enabled` is intentionally enabled
- review every seeded bossing method/rule marked `Needs client review`
- keep Priority and Express delivery disabled until the client approves those fees and estimates
- verify public estimates, admin bossing pages and mobile screenshots against staging data

Rollback is manual. First disable `bossing_calculator_enabled`, then export any admin-edited bossing rows and staged aggregates that must be retained. Remove dependent bossing stat and gear requirements, methods, bosses and rules before removing the Task 006 tables. Do not use `prisma migrate reset` against shared or production data.

## Premium configurator deployment notes

Task 007 adds migration `20260719190000_task007_premium_service_configurators`. It is additive and creates premium configurator tables for rules, packages, options, requirement groups, requirements and FAQs. It uses the existing `CatalogueService.engineType = PREMIUM_SERVICE_CONFIGURATOR` enum value.

Normal seed runs create `premium_configurator_enabled` disabled because the representative premium package prices and rules are still marked `Needs client review`. Staging or screenshot validation may enable the flag deliberately, but public rollout should wait for client-approved package pricing, requirement wording, option availability and delivery configuration.

Before enabling the configurator outside local validation:

- run `pnpm db:migrate` without reset
- run `pnpm db:seed` and confirm seed reruns preserve edited premium rules, packages, options, feature flags, staged aggregates and revisions
- review the GitHub Actions Task 007 validation artifacts when using PR-based handoff validation
- confirm the database feature flag `premium_configurator_enabled` is intentionally enabled
- review every seeded premium package, option and rule marked `Needs client review`
- keep Priority and Express delivery disabled until the client approves those fees and estimates
- verify public estimates, admin premium pages and mobile screenshots against staging data

Production still requires a real persistent MySQL database at deployment time. Do not point production at the temporary GitHub Actions MySQL service or any CI-only credentials.

Rollback is manual. First disable `premium_configurator_enabled`, then export any admin-edited premium rows and staged aggregates that must be retained. Remove dependent premium requirements, requirement groups, FAQs, options, packages and config before removing the Task 007 tables. Do not use `prisma migrate reset` against shared or production data.

## Global pricing deployment notes

Task 008 adds migration `20260723160000_task008_global_pricing_foundation`. It is additive and creates pricing rule sets, draft rules, applicability rows and immutable published pricing revisions.

Normal seed runs create:

- `global_pricing_enabled` disabled
- one neutral draft pricing rule set
- one neutral published pricing revision with zero rules
- `pricing.publish` permission for Super Admin through the default permission set

Before enabling global pricing outside validation:

- run `pnpm db:migrate` without reset
- run `pnpm db:seed` twice and confirm edited feature flags are preserved
- review `/admin/pricing` and publish a client-approved pricing revision
- confirm `global_pricing_enabled` is intentionally enabled
- verify public estimates for skilling, bossing and premium services
- review Task 008 validation artifacts when using PR-based handoff validation

Rollback is manual. First disable `global_pricing_enabled`, then export any admin-edited pricing rule sets, rules, revisions and audit rows that must be retained. Remove applicability rows, rules, revisions and rule sets in dependency order only after review. Do not use `prisma migrate reset` against shared or production data.

## Gold trading deployment notes

Task 009 adds migration `20260725130000_task009_gold_trading_engine`. It is additive and creates gold markets, draft/published rate sets, rates, immutable rate revisions, quantity presets and inventory ledger entries.

Normal seed runs create:

- the Gold category and `gold-trading` catalogue service
- one paused gold market
- draft customer-buy and customer-sell rates marked `Needs client review`
- quantity presets
- zero gold stock and zero buying capacity
- `gold_engine_enabled` disabled

Before enabling gold trading outside validation:

- run `pnpm db:migrate` without reset
- run `pnpm db:seed` twice and confirm edited gold rates, presets, balances, ledgers, revisions and feature flags are preserved
- review `/admin/gold` and publish a client-approved gold-rate revision
- enter real stock and buying capacity through inventory adjustments
- confirm `gold_engine_enabled` is intentionally enabled
- verify public buy/sell estimates and mobile screenshots against staging data

Rollback is manual. First disable `gold_engine_enabled`, then export any admin-edited gold rates, revisions, presets, inventory ledgers and audit rows that must be retained. Remove ledger entries, presets, revisions, rates, rate sets and markets in dependency order only after review. Do not use `prisma migrate reset` against shared or production data.

- confirm `account_marketplace_enabled` is intentionally enabled
- keep cart, checkout, payment, order, reservation and credential handover flows disabled until later tasks implement them

Rollback is manual. First disable `account_marketplace_enabled`, then export any admin-edited listings, revisions, holds, handover readiness rows and audit rows that must be retained. Remove account holds, revisions, images, features, unlocks, stats, checklists, listings and marketplaces in dependency order only after review. Do not use `prisma migrate reset` against shared or production data.

## Custom account-build deployment notes

Task 011 adds migration `20260728150000_task011_custom_account_build`. It is additive and creates custom-build service configuration, draft rule sets, skill/objective rules, immutable published revisions, persistent requests, request status history, quarantined attachment metadata, quotes, quote revisions, quote lines and customer quote decisions.
